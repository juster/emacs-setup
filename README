README -*- Org -*-

* Introduction
  This is my emacs configuration directory. Instead of having a large
  and cluttered ~/.emacs file I put everything into emacs-setup.el. The
  different customizations for each emacsen I use stay in the ~/.emacs
  file. The cross-platform code goes into emacs-setup.el. I clone this
  repo into my ~/emacs directory and off I go! At least I hope so.

  In my ~/.emacs file all I do is this:
  :(setq emacs-setup-dir "~/emacs")
  :(load "/emacs/emacs-setup"))

* Installation
** Org
   org-mode needs to be installed inside of this directory. The
   way I like to do it is extract the tarball and then create a symlink
   to the extracted directory called "org".
   
   Tracking org-mode with git proved to be too laborious for multiple
   emacs setups.

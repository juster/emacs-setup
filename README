README -*- Org -*-

* Introduction
  This is my emacs configuration directory. Instead of having a large
  and cluttered ~/.emacs file I put everything into emacsrc.el. The
  different customizations for each emacsen I use stay in the ~/.emacs
  file. The cross-platform code goes into emascrc.el. I clone this
  repo into my ~/emacs directory and off I go! At least I hope so.

  In my ~/.emacs file all I do is this:
  :(setq emacs-setup-dir "~/emacs")
  :(load "/emacs/emacs-setup"))
  :(load "screensetup"))

* Screen
  I use screen alot on my remote server logins. The screen code is
  inside screensetup.el. I have bash_profile setup so that a detached
  screen is reconnected when I login. If no screen is running a new
  screen session is started. I have aliased 'emacs' to run 'emacsclient'
  and create a new screen for the emacsclient.

  Maybe one day I will copy/paste the following webpage for reference:

* Installation
** Org
   org-mode needs to be installed inside of this directory. The
   way I like to do it is extract the tarball and then create a symlink
   to the extracted directory called "org".
   
   Tracking org-mode with git proved to be too laborious for multiple
   emacs setups.

* Introduction

This is my emacs configuration directory. Instead of having a large
and cluttered ~/.emacs file I put everything into emacsrc.el. The
different customizations for each emacsen I use stay in the ~/.emacs
file. The cross-platform code goes into emascrc.el. I clone this
repo into my ~/emacs directory and off I go! At least I hope so.

In my ~/.emacs file all I do is this:
(load "emacs/emacsrc.el")

* Screen

I use screen alot on my remote server logins. The screen code is
inside screensetup.el. I have bash_profile setup so that a detached
screen is reconnected when I login. If no screen is running a new
screen session is started. I have aliased 'emacs' to run 'emacsclient'
and create a new screen for the emacsclient.

Maybe one day I will copy/paste the following webpage for reference:

* Bugs

This won't work on Windows because the ~/emacs directory is hard-coded.
I will have to work on that next time I use Windows.
